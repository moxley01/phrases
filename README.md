### 2. Non Sequitur

### 3. Chesterton's Fence

### 4. Occam's Razor
A problem-solving principle that suggests the simplest solution is usually the best, provided it adequately addresses the problem.

### 5. Gold Plating
Adding unnecessary features to a project, increasing complexity and cost without proportional benefits.

### 6. Pareto Principle
The idea that roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes, often used to prioritize tasks in project management.

### 7. Heisenbug
A software bug that seems to disappear or change behavior when one attempts to study it.

### 8. Technical Debt
The implied cost of additional rework caused by choosing an easier solution now instead of using a better approach that would take longer.

### 9. Murphy's Law
The adage that anything that can go wrong will go wrong, emphasizing the importance of risk management.

### 10. Critical Path
The sequence of stages determining the minimum time needed to complete a project, crucial for project management.

### 11. Yak Shaving
Engaging in seemingly pointless activities that are actually necessary to solve a larger problem.

### 12. Boiling the Ocean
Attempting to solve a problem by taking on too much at once, rather than breaking it down into manageable parts.

### 13. Dogfooding
The practice of using one's own products or services to test and validate them before releasing to customers.

### 14. Bike-shedding

### 16. Black Swan
An unpredictable or unforeseen event, typically one with extreme consequences, often used in risk assessment.

### 17. Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

### 18. Elephant in the Room
An obvious problem or risk that no one wants to discuss, often due to discomfort or taboo.

### 19. Root Cause Analysis
A method of problem solving used to identify the underlying reasons for faults or problems.

### 20. Bleeding Edge
Refers to a product or technology so new that it has a high risk of being unreliable and may cause problems.

### 21. Post-Mortem
A process conducted after project completion to analyze what went wrong and what can be improved for future projects.

### 22. Scalability
The capability of a system, network, or process to handle a growing amount of work or its potential to be enlarged to accommodate that growth.

### 23. Waterfall Model
A sequential design process, often used in software development, where progress flows steadily downwards through phases like a waterfall.
